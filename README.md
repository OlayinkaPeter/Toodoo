## Be Sure To:
* Create a "Toodoo" project in your Firebase console.
* Add Android app to project.
* Ensure that **Email/Password** and **Google** Sign In methods in Authentication are enabled.
* Generate your project's **google-services.json** file and replace the current google-services.json file in the app-level directory.
* Use Android Studio to generate a SHA certificate for your project and add the key to your Firebase console for Google Sign In.
